Notejam project
***************

Do you know django/lavarel/symfony/etc and want to try rails/flask/pyramid/etc?
The easy way to start up with a new framework is to compare it with frameworks you already know.

Notejam is a simple web application (more than just Hello World) implemented using different server-side frameworks.

Compare, learn and have fun :)
