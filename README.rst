**The easy way to learn web frameworks**

Do you know django/laravel/symfony/etc and want to try rails/flask/pyramid/etc?
The easy way to start with a new framework is to compare it with frameworks you already know.
The goal of the project is to help developers easily learn new frameworks by examples.

Notejam is a unified sample web application (more than just "Hello World") implemented using different server-side frameworks.
Currently most popular python, php and ruby frameworks are supported.


**Is it like TodoMVC in Javascript?**

Yes, the idea is very similar.
