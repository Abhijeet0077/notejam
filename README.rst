***************
Notejam project
***************

Do you know django/yii/symfony/... and want to try rails/flask/pyramid/...? One of the
most easiest way to start up with a new framework is to compare it with frameworks you already know.

Notejam is a simple web application (more than just Hello World) implemented using different popular server-side frameworks.

Compare, learn and have fun :)
